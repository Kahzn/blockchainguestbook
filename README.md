# This simple online guestbook application was built upon the [Start Bootstrap - One Page Wonder](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/one-page-wonder/) theme
The application was built loosely around the blockchain principle:

 - Every entry has a reference to its own hash and the hash of the previous entry
 - the current hash is made up of the current entry's contents and the previous hash
 - At the moment, both hashes are for demonstration purposes only, but could be used for validation functionality further down the line.
